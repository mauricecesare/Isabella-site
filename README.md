*"She, Macro said, had her hair spread over her head in such a way that it ran off her lovely and delicate shoulders; and it was gathered in a hairnet of auburn silk, which had been worked with such skilful craftsmanship that to me the knots seemed to be of the finest gold; and through the mesh of this hairnet, which was rather large, you could see her locks of hair shining almest like sunbeams that sparkled everywhere. In the middle of her forehead, where the hair is parted, she had a very beautiful and glowing ruby, from which a shiny and large pearl was dangling; and around her neck she had a string of very large and splendid pearls, which hung down from one side and the other of her ehest almost to her belt; she wore a beautiful and rich dress of black velvet, loaded with very well-placed gold buckles, and everything she had on her was so admirably decorated that it seemed as if the artisans had wanted to compete with nature itself."*


Gesprächsdialog zwischen Pietro Bembo und Macro Vicenzio über Marcos Sichtung von Isabella D'Este in Ferrara. Dialog ist festgehalten im Ritratti" von Gian Giorgio Trissino, welches um 1524 veröffentlicht wurde.


## Wer ist Isabella D'Este?

Zu ihren Lebzeiten war Isabella weithin als Verkörperung der Eleganz und als führende Vorreiterin der Modewelt bekannt. Da das Originalporträt von Tizian leider verloren gegangen ist, stellt Rubens' Kopie eine wichtige visuelle Quelle für Isabellas Kleidung dar.

[why](#why), [what](#what), [how](#how) & [who](#who). 


A *Syllabus Site* is a one-page website arranging its elements along sections that can be scrolled vertically.


### Design

The webpage is designed with the aim to open an evocative information space, where the sources that foster creativity, dialogue, and learning can be gathered, recapitulated, and appreciated. The monolithic structure of conventional documents is broken up, by introducing a relational quality to the connections between sections and items.


### Structure

There are two main types of elements:

- **Sections** – Larger blocks gather the material for weekly course sessions.
- **Items** – Smaller elements feature images, text, and other content.

Each item is connected with its section by a thin line. The navigation (≡) gives access to all sections.

The last section acts as the footer, where the typical array of logos and links belongs.


### Examples

The template is in use to document the following [Interface Design](https://interface.fh-potsdam.de) courses offered at [FH Potsdam](https://www.fh-potsdam.de/):

- **[Decolonizing Data Visualization – Visualizing Postcolonies](https://infovis.fh-potsdam.de/decolonizing/)** (Summer 2022)
- **[Organigrams for/from the future](https://infovis.fh-potsdam.de/organigrams/)** (Summer 2023)

## How

The *Syllabus Site* template can be easily used with minimal technical requirements.


![](img/sidebyside.webp)  
Page content and source side by side


### Get started

1. Download or clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/uclab-potsdam/syllabus-site/)
2. Give your page a title, fill out open graph fields, and adjust theme color in `index.html`
3. Add your content into `README.md` and `img/`


### Files

The template has the following file structure:

      img/
      index.html
      src/
      README.md

The `README.md` file contains all the textual content of your page and references the images that you need to add to the `img/` directory. 

The `index.html` file connects template and your content; here you need to make a few edits to add title, description, and preview of your webpage. 

You do not need to change anything within `src/`, which contains the internal files of the template.


### Syntax

The `README.md` uses the [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format, a markup language used by many platforms including GitHub.

There are two conventions we introduce to distinguish and connect sections and items:

- **Sections** are delineated by a horizontal rule `---` 
- **Items** are separated by two empty consecutive lines

Each section should contain a heading:
`#` for primary, `##` for secondary, and so on.

To exclude a section from the navigation menu, include `<!--skipnav-->` at the start of the section.



### Things to consider

- Include an expressive preview image `img/cover.png` so that your page can be previewed on social media and messaging apps.
- Given that your webpage might be accessed from a mobile device with a slow connection make sure to optimize image file sizes.
